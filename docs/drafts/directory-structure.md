# Directory Structure

This document defines the intended directory structure for the generated content and its purpose.

## Operating System Considerations

Initially, the focus is on a Linux-based environment as it is the primary development OS. Support for other operating systems will be explicitly and automatically handled later. However, the system will be configurable from the start to allow easy adaptation to any OS.

## Default Paths (Linux)

The following default paths will be used on a Linux-like system:

*   **Configuration:** `~/.config/clio`
*   **Database:** `~/.clio`
*   **Documents Root:** `~/Documents/Clio/`
    *   **Markdown Source:** `markdown/`
    *   **Generated HTML:** `html/`
    *   **Assets:** `assets/images/`
